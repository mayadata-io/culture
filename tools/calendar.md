# How To use Google Calendar

Google Calendar is an essential tool for planning time, thus for allowing people to schedule calls and meet each other. But also to allow for keeping your work-life balance in check.

## Allow access to your calendar

Go to Settings and click on your calendar:

![My calendar settings](cal/settings.png)

Make sure, that you have allowed other in the company to see your events:

## Allow guest to modify invites

Please make sure, that you have set `Default guest permission under Settings -> General -> Event settings` to `Modify event` (or at least to `Invite others`). This setting will allow your guests to add other people to meetings, add dial-in details, extend description etc.

## Shared calendars

### MayaData shared calendar

MayaData uses shared calendars for events like all hands calls, continuous improvement initiatives & demo days.

A number of shared calendars exist. To add the "MayaData Team Meetings" calendar please do the following:

* Scroll down on the left hand pane of your [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar) and click on the `+` next to `Other calendars`

* Choose `From URL` in the dialog:
 
  <img alt="Second step - choose from URL" src="cal/shared-cal-add-2.png" width="256px">

* When presented with the URL you would like to add use:

  ```
  https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y19zMmNlYzZwOGdhaXUxNmRjaDJ0YnFmazZ1a0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t
  ```

### Holidays in different countries

On the similar note, you can easily add calendars showing holidays in your home or other countries. It looks like this for me:

You can easily add other countries. Hit the `+` sign and then `Browse calendars of interest -> Regional holidays` and find the country of interest.

## Speedy meetings

We suggest using Speedy meetings also under `Settings -> General -> Event settings`. That shortens up meetings a bit â€“ end 30 minute meetings 5 minutes early and longer meetings 10 minutes early. That will allow people to have consecutive meetings scheduled (have you ever came late to the meeting because you need to go to the bathroom?).

## Working hours

Set your working hours to give hint to the others, when they should be scheduling meetings with you.

## World clock

Google Calendar has built in simple world clock. I find it quite useful for making a quick decision if I am going to reach out to someone or send an email. You will find it under `Settings -> General -> World clock`.

Let's take a look at my settings. My configuration looks like:

That will result into
