# Backend Engineering

## Overview

At MayaData we believe that the best way to deliver storage and related services to containerized and cloud-native environments is with containerized and cloud-native architectures. Everything we do is focused on providing data agility and simplifying the daily operation of Kubernetes SREâ€™s and DevOps teams using Kubernetes as a data layer. We enable our users to handle complex data management operations easily, and we have become open source leaders in building Kubernetes into a first-class data platform.

### Backend Engineer Performance Indicators

Here are some ways that a Backend Engineer can self evaluate or work with the reporting manager to track the growth. A good practice would be to have a combination of qualitative and quantitative indicators.

- Shift Left Index with issues caught identified before merging as opposed to E2e Testing or User Testing.
- Mean Time To Merge
- Mean Time To Review
- Backend automated Unit Test / BDD Coverage - Target is 60%
- Number of Peer Reviews completed
- Number of PRs merged
- Community and Customer Issues resolved.
