# Backend Engineering

## Overview

At MayaData we believe that the best way to deliver storage and related services to containerized and cloud-native environments is with containerized and cloud-native architectures. Everything we do is focused on providing data agility and simplifying the daily operation of Kubernetes SRE’s and DevOps teams using Kubernetes as a data layer. We enable our users to handle complex data management operations easily, and we have become open source leaders in building Kubernetes into a first-class data platform.


Backend Engineers at MayaData work on our products. This includes both the open-source products like OpenEBS, Litmus, Data Agility Operators and the enterprise edition shipped through OpenEBS Director. They work with peers on teams dedicated to areas of the product. They work together with product managers, designers, and front-end engineers to solve common goals. They work with community users and enterprise customers.

### Backend Engineer Performance Indicators

Here are some ways that a Backend Engineer can self evaluate or work with the reporting manager to track the growth. A good practice would be to have a combination of qualitative and quantitative indicators.

- Shift Left Index with issues caught identified before merging as opposed to E2e Testing or User Testing.
- Mean Time To Merge
- Mean Time To Review
- Backend automated Unit Test / BDD Coverage - Target is 60%
- Number of Peer Reviews completed
- Number of PRs merged
- Community and Customer Issues resolved.

## Backend Engineer Levels
