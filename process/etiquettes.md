# Household manners

This section covers some suggestions that are considered good household manners. 

## Cultural sensitivities
We are spread across geographies and different cultures. 
- We will use open channels for communication as much as possible to keep the conversations transparent.
- In case there are direct discussions between two individuals, the relevant content will be diligently documented and posted on Slack for everyone's benefit.
- Each of us will remain sensitive to make comments about an individual’s ignorance in the meetings and slack channels. No questions are stupid.

## Online meetings (voice or video)
- On-time, there is always a ramp-up time due to unforeseen reboots which we all have which is fine
- Be prepared, find a calm place, with as little background noise as possible
- Don’t eat during the call the crispy sounds can be heard better than you think!
- Mute yourself, there’s a mute button for a reason. It might not seem like it, but there’s a lot of background noise even in the quietest of offices. There may also be feedback you can’t hear, but everyone else can. Unless you’re speaking, keep your phone on mute. However, don’t use this feature as an excuse to sneak a snack. Refer back to the last point for a reminder.
- Make sure to say goodbye, and do so with a smile
- When group calling, don't use a cell phone on speaker, they are not sufficient
- If you must use for whatever reason (did you prepare?) make sure that it does not vibrate

## In-person meetings / Online meetings
- Plan to attend on time, others are waiting for you
- Meetings are scheduled to discuss openly with an expected outcome of clearing doubts if there are any. Ask your doubts in the meeting. A meeting is not successful if you had a doubt before the meeting, and it continues to exist after meeting because you did not bring it up
- Avoid one-on-one chats in the meeting. 
- Feel free to share information. Make it short, precise and relevant to the meeting agenda. Try not to interrupt a team member when they are speaking.
