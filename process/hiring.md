# Hiring

- Each hiring process will begin with the job responsibility spec and 6-12 months plan
- We will always be open to hiring the right individuals that complement the skills of the team from anywhere in the world, by compensating as per the market standards.
- We will project and plan the budget as much as possible. However, the release milestones will not wait for resources to join and ramp-up.
- When individual team members may be required to play dual or multiple roles to help make progress on the milestones while the new hires or team members join, the impact is analyzed and documented. We will be sensitive to the current skills and career ambitions of the individuals.
