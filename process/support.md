# Product Support

The success of the Company and Product depends on the users. Everyone in the company is responsible for supporting the users. 
- The users for the product include the open source community, partners and paying customers. Everyone in the company will work towards establishing credibility with the users.
- Everyone will have an opportunity to volunteer to be the point of contact for a day (or half a day?) for OpenEBS and StorageSIG.
- Engineers from all teams will take turns answering questions, updating users by name as we complete issues, and welcoming new users and more.
- Engineers will be evaluated in part on their work when they are the point for a day or half a day - and for their responsiveness when an issue is brought to their attention.
